# mμprosody

(Smaller) fork of (myprosody)[https://github.com/Shahabks/myprosody]

mμprosody, where μ is because it is a smaller size and contains only a subset of the features in the original script.

This fork modernises and updates some of the Praat script.

There are three methods:

`run_myspsolution_praat_file`

`run_mltrnl_praat_file`

`score_cefr_level`

The scikit-learn models for predicting CEFR levels from the original repository have been converted to ONNX format so as to no longer require a pin to a specific (and old) version of sklearn.

Visit the (myprosody)[https://github.com/Shahabks/myprosody] repository for further details.
